# Mc-OS-themes
(Formerly known as Gnome-OSC-themes) 

This is a repository that contains Mac OS-themes for the Linux-Gnome desktop made by PaulXFCE (myself)

These are high end and thorougly developed GTK-themes for the gnome desktop (3.20+ through 3.28) that interpretes the Mac Os themes to the gnome-environment. 

In the latest version (McOS-MJV)  I've modernized it in every little detail. There is nothing (not a single item) that is not new. Resulting in a completely rewritten GTK.CSS-file.  it also contains the dark-mode (for applications that use it)

The dark-mode is also available as a seperate theme (McOS-MJV-Dark-Mode), which has the benifit of having GTK2-applications enjoy the same dark mode. 

##MC-OS-MJV

This is a gnome-interpretation of the Mac OS Mojave (TM) desktop, with the benifit of the dark mode
